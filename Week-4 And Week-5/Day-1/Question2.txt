You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

    bool found(string p, char x){

            if(p[i]==x)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        int counter=0;
        for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            if(found(J, S[i])){counter++;}
        }
        return counter;
