Q.Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.






class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> answer;
        int low=0, high=numbers.size()-1;
        
        while(low<high){
            if(numbers[low]+numbers[high]==target){answer.push_back(low+1);answer.push_back(high+1);break;}
            else if(numbers[low]+numbers[high]>target){high--;}
            else{low++;}
        }
        return answer;
        
        
    }
};
